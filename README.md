# Real Estate Registry

A decentralized real estate registry built on blockchain technology using Solidity smart contracts. This project provides a transparent, immutable, and secure platform for property ownership registration, transfer, and management.

## Project Description

The Real Estate Registry is a blockchain-based solution that revolutionizes property ownership management by leveraging the transparency and immutability of distributed ledger technology. Built on the Core Testnet 2 blockchain, this smart contract system enables secure property registration, ownership transfers, and status updates while maintaining a complete audit trail of all transactions.

The system addresses critical issues in traditional real estate management including fraud prevention, ownership disputes, lack of transparency, and inefficient paper-based processes. By utilizing blockchain technology, we create a tamper-proof registry that can be accessed and verified by all stakeholders in the real estate ecosystem.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a globally accessible, transparent, and efficient real estate registry that eliminates fraud, reduces transaction costs, and streamlines property ownership processes. We aim to build a foundation for a trustless real estate ecosystem where property rights are universally recognized and easily transferable across borders.

**Long-term Goals:**
- Establish a global standard for blockchain-based property registration
- Integrate with government land registries and legal systems
- Enable fractional property ownership through tokenization
- Create a comprehensive ecosystem including property valuation, insurance, and financing
- Bridge the gap between traditional real estate and DeFi (Decentralized Finance)

- Emergency registrar change functionality

### üìä **Analytics & Reporting**
- Total property count tracking
- Property ownership distribution
- Transaction volume monitoring
- Event-based activity logging

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Functions

#### Core Functions:
1. **`registerProperty()`** - Register new properties in the system
2. **`transferProperty()`** - Transfer ownership with payment processing
3. **`updatePropertyStatus()`** - Modify property sale status and pricing

#### View Functions:
- `getProperty()` - Retrieve property details
- `getPropertiesByOwner()` - Get all properties owned by an address
- `getTotalProperties()` - Get total registered properties count

#### Administrative Functions:
- `changeRegistrar()` - Transfer registrar role (emergency use)

### Data Structures

```solidity
struct Property {
    uint256 id;
    string location;
    uint256 area;
    uint256 price;
    address owner;
    bool isForSale;
    bool exists;
    uint256 registrationDate;
}
```

### Events
- `PropertyRegistered` - New property registration
- `PropertyTransferred` - Ownership transfer completion
- `PropertyStatusChanged` - Property status/price updates

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-registry.git
cd real-estate-registry
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Environment setup:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your private key and configuration
```

4. **Compile contracts:**
```bash
npm run compile
```

5. **Run tests:**
```bash
npm test
```

6. **Deploy to Core Testnet 2:**
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Usage

### Deploying the Contract

```bash
# Deploy to Core Testnet 2
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network core_testnet2

# Deploy to local network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### Contract Interaction Examples

```javascript
// Register a new property
await realEstateRegistry.registerProperty(
  "123 Main Street, City, State 12345",
  2500, // 2500 sq ft
  ethers.parseEther("1.5"), // 1.5 CORE
  ownerAddress
);

// Transfer property ownership
await realEstateRegistry.transferProperty(
  propertyId,
  newOwnerAddress,
  { value: ethers.parseEther("1.5") }
);

// Update property status
await realEstateRegistry.updatePropertyStatus(
  propertyId,
  true, // for sale
  ethers.parseEther("2.0") // new price
);
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage for all contract functions:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npx hardhat test test/RealEstateRegistry.test.js

# Run tests with gas reporting
REPORT_GAS=true npm test
```

## Network Configuration
